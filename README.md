# Facial Recognition using OpenCV and SVM

This project implements a facial recognition system using `face_recognition`, `OpenCV`, and `scikit-learn`'s SVM classifier. It allows you to train a face recognition model on your own images and then use a webcam to identify people in real-time. You can add images of you and your friends in the dataset for your recognition also.
